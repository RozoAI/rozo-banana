# Authentication Loop Fix Summary

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. **401 Errors Causing Logout Loop**
**Problem:** When API returned 401 errors (because backend doesn't accept SUPABASE_ANON_KEY), it triggered logout ‚Üí set auth_expired ‚Üí show message ‚Üí repeat

**Fix:** Modified `handleAuthError` in `api.ts`:
- Only logout if we have a real user token (not anon key)
- Don't logout for 401 errors when using anon key (expected behavior)
- Added check: `hasUserToken` before triggering logout

### 2. **Address Mismatch Clearing localStorage**
**Problem:** In `page.tsx`, there was logic that cleared all localStorage when signed address didn't match current address

**Fix:** Commented out the problematic logic:
- We don't require signing for basic wallet connection anymore
- This was incorrectly clearing user data and causing loops

### 3. **Points API Failure Handling**
**Problem:** When points API failed with 401, it wasn't handled gracefully

**Fix:** Added try-catch in `MobileDashboard.tsx`:
- Catches 401 errors specifically
- Shows default value (0) instead of failing
- Logs informative message instead of error

### 4. **Address Comparison Issues**
**Problem:** Address comparisons were case-sensitive, causing mismatches

**Fix:** Updated `useAuth.ts`:
- Compare addresses in lowercase
- Added error handling for JSON parsing
- More robust address matching

## Expected Behavior Now

### When Connecting Wallet:
1. Wallet connects ‚Üí Address saved to localStorage
2. Dashboard shows immediately (no signature required)
3. API calls attempt with SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
4. If API returns 401 ‚Üí Log message but don't logout
5. Show default values if data can't be fetched

### No More:
- ‚ùå Session expired messages on loop
- ‚ùå Automatic logout when using anon key
- ‚ùå localStorage being cleared unexpectedly
- ‚ùå Page refreshing repeatedly

## Console Messages You Should See

### Normal Flow:
```
üîó [WalletConnectButton] Wallet connected, saving address: 0x...
üìä [MobileDashboard] Fetching user data for address: 0x...
üîé [handleAuthError] Anon key rejected by endpoint (expected for some APIs)
üí∞ [MobileDashboard] Points API requires authentication, showing default
```

### NOT These (which caused the loop):
```
‚ùå [handleAuthError] Token invalid/expired, logging out...  // This should NOT appear for anon key
Session expired. Please sign in again.  // This should NOT appear in loop
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Clear Everything First:**
   ```javascript
   // Run in browser console
   localStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```

2. **Connect Wallet:**
   - Should connect without signature
   - Should NOT show "session expired"
   - Should NOT reload page

3. **Check Console:**
   - Should see "Anon key rejected" messages (this is OK)
   - Should NOT see "logging out" messages
   - Should NOT see repeated auth errors

4. **Navigate Pages:**
   - Should be able to navigate without issues
   - Data might show as 0 (expected without auth)
   - No logout loops

## Key Code Changes

### api.ts - handleAuthError:
```typescript
// Before: Always logout on 401
if (error.response?.status === 401) {
  // logout
}

// After: Only logout with user token
const hasUserToken = localStorage.getItem("rozo_token");
if (error.response?.status === 401 && hasUserToken) {
  // logout only if we had a real token
}
```

### page.tsx:
```typescript
// Before: Clear localStorage on address mismatch
if (signedAddressesObj.address !== address) {
  localStorage.removeItem("rozo_token");
  // ... clearing everything
}

// After: Commented out this problematic logic
```

### MobileDashboard.tsx:
```typescript
// Added error handling for 401
catch (pointsError) {
  if (pointsError.response?.status === 401) {
    console.log("Points API requires authentication, showing default");
    setPoints(0);
  }
}
```

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ No more "Session expired" messages in loop
‚úÖ Page doesn't refresh repeatedly
‚úÖ Can connect wallet and stay connected
‚úÖ Dashboard shows even without full authentication
‚úÖ Console shows informative messages instead of errors
‚úÖ localStorage isn't cleared unexpectedly
